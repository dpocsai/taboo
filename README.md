# taboo

A digitized version of the classic board game Taboo. Participants are arranged in partners, with one participant being the "guesser", and one the "clue-giver". The clue giver takes a card which has 1 answer word, and several taboo (forbidden) words. They must make their partner guess the answer word without saying any of the taboo words. 

Features:

1) Customization for the number of teams involved, and team names.
2) Customization for the number of rounds of play
3) Customization for time-limit of each round
4) Automated scoring with display for each teams scores
5) Ability to skip a card (with a penalty)
6) includes a "buzzer" to be used when a taboo word is said out loud
